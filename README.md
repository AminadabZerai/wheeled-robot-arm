## About
This project aims to design and build a wheeled mobile robot equipped with a manipulator arm. It combines mechanical design, electronics, embedded systems, and high-level control using ROS 2.

The robot is divided into clear development sections, making it an ideal platform to demonstrate skills in mechatronics, embedded software development, and system integration.

## Features
- Wheeled platform with mecanum or differential drive
- Distributed motor controllers using Seeed XIAO or Teensy
- Local encoder reading and motor control per wheel
- High-level command interface via Raspberry Pi (ROS 2)
- ROS 2 nodes for movement, localization, and arm control
- Modular manipulator arm with inverse kinematics
- Detailed documentation and schematics
